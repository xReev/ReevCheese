New: Flashed Eye Indicator - A small eye icon now appears near a player's head when they're flashed. The icon gets brighter the more flashed they are, and fades out as the flash wears off.
Enemy & Team Support - You can toggle the flashed eye separately for enemies and teammates, so you always know who's blind.
Custom Color - Pick your own color for the eye icon (separate colors for enemy and team).
Adjustable Size - Slider to make the eye icon bigger or smaller (8px to 30px).
