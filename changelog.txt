Custom Model Safety
Extra Model Checks - bad or malformed model names are now filtered out before they can be applied.
File Existence Guard - missing model files are skipped so invalid installs won’t crash the game.
Safe Apply Fallback - if a model fails to load, the change is cancelled to keep you stable.
