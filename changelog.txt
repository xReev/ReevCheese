UI / Color Picker
Opaque Picker Popup - The color picker now opens on a solid dark panel with rounded corners and a subtle border, so it no longer shows the game behind it.
Clean Layout - Added comfortable padding and spacing for a smoother, higher-quality look while picking colors.
Fix - A bug where you would selected a cornered color but it would pick a different color.
