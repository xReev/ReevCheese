Legitbot / Triggerbot
New Magnet Triggerbot - Triggerbot now slightly “pulls” your shot toward a nearby enemy when your crosshair is close (more natural than a strict pixel-perfect trigger).
More Reliable Shots - Improved how attack inputs are sent so shots register more consistently.
Smarter Targeting - Picks the closest target within a small FOV instead of only firing on a perfect crosshair trace.
Simplified Settings - Triggerbot options are now cleaner and easier to understand.

UI / Indicators
Legit Indicators Update - Indicators are now focused on legitbot features (Legitbot, Triggerbot, Silent Aim, Auto Stop, RCS, Assisted Recoil) instead of rage-related indicators.
