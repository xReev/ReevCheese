Grenade Helper (BETA)
New Nade Helper Feature - Added a brand new grenade helper system to help you throw perfect smokes, flashes, molotovs and HE grenades.
Aim Assist - When you pull out a grenade near a saved lineup spot, the crosshair will guide you to the correct throwing position and angle.
Visual Guides - See on-screen indicators showing you exactly where to stand and where to aim.
Multiple Throw Types - Supports normal throws, jump throws, and run throws.
Map-Based Lineups - Lineups are saved per-map, so your spots carry over between sessions.
Easy to Use - Just equip a grenade and the helper will show you nearby lineup spots automatically.

Note: This feature is currently in BETA and still under active development. More lineup spots and improvements coming soon!
