Stability Fixes
Fixed Map Transition Crash - The game no longer crashes when switching maps or joining servers. The particle effects system is now properly protected during loading.
Fixed Random Disconnection Crash - Resolved an access violation crash that could occur randomly when leaving a server or during round restarts.

Skin Changer
Improved Model Protection - Added smarter protection that only blocks problematic model changes while allowing normal skin changes to work properly.
Better Error Handling - Invalid or corrupted skin data is now silently ignored instead of causing crashes.

General
More Stable Online Play - The cheese is now much more stable during competitive matches and doesn't interfere with normal game operations.
Reduced "Bad Resource" Errors - Fixed an issue where the game would log errors about invalid model names.
