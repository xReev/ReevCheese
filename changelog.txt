> ## Visuals / Bullet Tracers
> - **New “Zapper Tracers”** - Added a new electric-style tracer that looks like a zig-zag lightning bolt, making shots easier to see.
> - **New Tracer Styles** - You can now pick different tracer looks:
>   - Default
>   - Zapper (electric)
>   - Beam (laser)
>   - Pulse (pulsing glow)
>   - Rainbow (color cycling)
>   - Plasma (energy style)
> - **Separate Settings** - Local, Enemy, and Team tracers can each have their own style and color.
> - **Simple Extra Sliders (only when needed)**
>   - Zapper/Lightning: **Segments** + **Amplitude** (controls how “zig-zag” it is)
>   - Beam: **Width** (controls how thick it is)
> - **Performance Friendly** - Limits are in place to keep things smooth and avoid FPS drops.
> 
> ## How To Enable
> - Menu → **World** → **Effects**
> - Turn on **Local Bullet Tracers** (and/or Enemy/Team)
> - Pick a **Tracer Style**
> - Adjust sliders if your selected style has them
