> 
> ## Stability Fix
> - **Crash Fix** - Fixed a random crash that could happen while playing (access violation). The cheese now properly validates game entities before accessing them.
> 
> ## Team Damage Indicator (Redesigned)
> - **New Clean Design** - Completely redesigned with a modern, smooth overlay style that matches Reev's menu colors.
> - **Alive/Dead Status** - The dot next to each player now shows if they're alive (green) or dead (red).
> - **Enemy Damage Tracking** - Now shows how much damage each teammate has done to enemies, plus their kills.
> - **Better Layout** - Each teammate is shown in a clean card with their name, enemy stats, and team damage progress bar.
> - **Kick Warning** - Pulsing "KICK WARNING" text appears when a teammate is close to getting kicked for team damage.
> - **Dead Player Dimming** - Dead teammates appear dimmed so you can focus on who's still alive.
> - **Local Player Highlight** - Your own stats are highlighted with the accent color and shown as "YOU".
> 
>  ## Stability Fix
> **Fixed Game Crash** - Resolved a crash that could occur when using Custom Model, Agent, or Gloves features. The game would freeze with a "Resource System" error — this is now fixed.
> **Custom Model** - Currently disabled to investigate the crashes it was causing.
