Legitbot Target Stability
No More FOV Flicker - aiming stays steady when a target is perfectly centered in your FOV.
Smoother Target Lock - lock now ignores tiny one-tick hiccups so it doesn’t snap away.
Less Hitbox Jumping - reduces micro-switching between hitboxes to keep aim consistent.
Legitbot Menu - fixed the per-weapon RCS selector state so the menu stays stable.
