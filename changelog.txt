Legit Aim Direction Fix
No More Wrong-Way Snaps - aiming now resets correctly when you press the aim key again, so it won’t swing to the opposite side of the target.

OOF Arrow Direction Fix
Correct Direction - off-screen arrows now point toward the enemy and stay pinned to their screen edge position instead of circling when you move.
